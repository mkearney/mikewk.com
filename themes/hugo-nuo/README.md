  baiduTongji = "baidu_tongji_code"
```

**Social Comments**

The hugo-nuo theme support [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) and [Chang Yan](https://changyan.kuaizhan.com/) social comment system, In China you can choose Chang Yan because Disqus is blocked by GFW.

```toml

disqusShortname = "disqus_shortname"

[params]
  # Changyan Comments (China Only)
  changyan = false
  changyanId = "your_changyan_id"
  changyanConf = "your_changyan_conf"
```

If you want to use Disqus, you should disable `changyan` to `false`.

### The works page

The works page layout is under development, you can use github homepage for replacement temporarily.

### The links page

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```bash
$ hugo new links.md
$ mkdir data && touch data/links.yml
$ mkdir -p content/media/links
$ vim content/links.md
```

Change the content of `links.md`, set page layout to `links`, If you want to add about page to menu, set menu to `main` and `weight` to 30.

```markdown
---
title: "Links"
date: 2017-08-02
layout: "links"
menu: "main"
weight: 30
---
```

The links page read data from `data/link.yml` file, now you can add friend's links there. The format looks like:

```yaml
01_link:
  title: chekun's blog
  link: https://chekun.me
  avatar: /media/links/chekun.jpg
  description: A full-stack PHP developer

02_link:
  title: Boof Wang
  link: http://boof.wang
  avatar: /media/links/wangbo.jpg
  description: Another full-stack PHP developer
```

The links page need friend's avatar, finally you should add friend's avatar to `content/media/links` directory and link to avatar in the `links.yml` file.

### The about page

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```bash
$ hugo new about.md
$ vim content/about.md
```

Change the content of `about.md`, set page layout to `about`, If you want to add about page to menu, set menu to `main` and `weight` to 40.

```markdown
---
title: "About"
date: 2017-08-02
layout: "about"
menu: "main"
weight: 40
comments: false
---

Write something about you here.
```

Write your portfolio as a post here, if you want comments in about page, you should turn comments to `true`.

## Build

If you want to modify styles and scripts by yourself, you should install dev packages by `npm install`, I use [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for styles development, [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) for scripts development, inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```bash
# Install dependences
$ cd themes/hugo-nuo
$ npm install

# Scripts dev
$ npm run dev
$ npm run build

# Styles dev
$ npm run sass

# Copy fonts to static
$ npm run fonts

# Copy images to static
$ npm run images

# Scripts lint
$ npm run eslint

# Styles lint
$ npm run stylelint

# Minify images
$ npm run imagemin
```

If you want to build hugo-nuo theme, you should have `node` and `npm` evironment installed. Besides, you should have dependencies below installed.

* [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) - Makes images load faster
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) - Ruby version SASS compiler
* [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) - Python syntax hightlighter

*From Hugo 0.28, the default syntax hightlighter in Hugo is [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma); it is built in Go and is really, really fast – and for the most important parts compatible with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).*

```bash
$ hugo gen chromastyles --style=monokai > ./src/styles/partials/syntax.css
```

Run hugo gen `chromastyles -h` for more options. See <https://help.farbox.com/pygments.html> for a gallery of available styles.

## Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```bash
$ hugo server -w
```

Now enter [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
