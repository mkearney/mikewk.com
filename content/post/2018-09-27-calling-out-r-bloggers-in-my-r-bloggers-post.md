Allow me to preface this post by saying I'm a big fan of 
[R-bloggers](https://r-bloggers.com), a content aggregating site focusing on 
blog posts about R. It serves a useful purpose–a centralized directory of 
"over 750" R-related blogs–and appears to have a considerable reach–50k email 
subscribers, 60k+ Twitter followers, etc. And although what follows may seem 
combative, I honestly hope R-bloggers continues to operate
and inspire people to use R for years to come. With that said, the goal of this
post is to make the case that R-bloggers should be better. Toward this end, this
post proceeds by making three points.

1. The basic service provided by R-bloggers can easily be automated
1. R-bloggers profits from content even though it produces none
1. R-bloggers requirements are incommensurate with its contributions

## The basic service provided by R-bloggers can easily be automated

Without scraping the R-bloggers website or Twitter feed, I was easily able to 
accumulate a large list of R-related blogs and then automate a feed of links to 
blog posts. The task was so easy, I even decided to expand the aim of my 
content aggregating feed to be about data-science more generally–hence, I named 
it `data-scribers`. You can see the site for yourself at 
[data-scribers.mikewk.com](https://data-scribers.mikewk.com).
