<p>I still remember how hard it was to learn <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org">{ggplot2}</a>
after only knowing a little about R<sup>1</sup>. Sure, the plots seemed pretty.
But compared to the ways I had used R before, <code>{ggplot2}</code>’s syntax seemed almost
counter-intuitive. Its pipe-like <code>+</code> workflow–building layer-by-layer–
was like nothing I had ever used before. Not to mention, I was unfamiliar
with central terms of art like “<code>geom</code>s” and “<code>aes</code>thetics”.</p>
<p>But then again…the plots were <strong>really pretty</strong>.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, <em>being able to generate pretty plots</em> was a powerful
motivator. Because not long after committing myself to learning how to <code>{ggplot2}</code>,
I realized why everyone likes it so much–it’s actually really
easy! Once I learned about the key building blocks of <code>ggplot()</code>, <code>aes()</code>,
and <code>geom_.*()</code>), I could create pretty plots for all sorts of data types and
relationships.</p>

<h3>It’s in the details</h3>
<p>Over time my <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats%20%23dataviz&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=image">#dataviz</a>
has <a href="https://twitter.com/kearneymw/status/762833157578162180/photo/1">gotten</a> a lot <a href="https://twitter.com/kearneymw/status/1040702237310365701/photo/1">better</a>, but it’s had very little
to do the actual plotting of data points (<code>{ggplot2}</code> outputs beautiful plots by
default). Instead, my dataviz has improved because I learned how to (a) more
effectively label scales, data points, and other dimensions of a plot and (b)
(re)size and save high-resolution plots using nice-looking fonts.</p>
<p>With this in mind, my goal with this post is to demonstrate how data
visualizations can be improved via proper labelling. And since this idea was
inspired by my <a href="../2018-09-17-tick-marks-var-names-and-ggplot2">last post</a>,
I will extend the example about the relationship between miles per gallon and
number of cylinders. If you read the setup section from the last post, you can
skip ahead (it’s the same).</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>To follow along with the examples in this post, you will need to load the
<a href="https://tidyverse.org">{tidyverse}</a> set of packages and define a couple stylistic
functions used throughout to make the plots even prettier.</p>

<p>The data set featured in this post is <strong>mtcars</strong>, which is bundled as part of
the core <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html">datasets</a>
package. Specifically, examples will feature the <code>mpg</code> (miles per gallon)
and <code>cyl</code> (number of cylinders) variables.</p>

<h2>Labelling dataviz</h2>
<p>I think most would agree a <em>good</em> data visualization clearly
conveys a pattern (or lack of pattern) while being easy to understand, while a
<em>great</em> data visualization conveys a pattern (or lack of pattern) while
being easy to understand <strong>and aesthetically pleasing</strong>. The difference between
<em>good</em> and <em>great</em> can be something as minor as color palette, but, in my
experience, more often than not the only difference between a good visualization
and great visualizations is labelling.</p>
<p>In my last post, for example, the first successful plot of <code>mpg</code> by <code>cyl</code> was
only <em>okay</em>–it’s a little bland and it uses an actual expression for an axis title.</p>
<p style="align:center">
<img src="/img/tick-marks.png">
</p>
<p>But then I replaced the expression and added a custom theme and a few more labels,
and I think it started to border on being <em>good</em>.</p>
<p style="align:center">
<img src="/img/with-labs.png">
</p>
<p>The combination of style changes and labels clearly made a big difference but, still,
I don’t think the above plot is mind-blowing or overly impressive.</p>
<p>Since there aren’t <em>that</em> many data points, I think this visualization can be
further improved–with the help of <a href="https://github.com/slowkow/ggrepel"><code>{ggrepel}</code></a>–by
labelling the individual data points–either as an additional layer or as a
standalone plot (I didn’t think the summarized <code>cyl</code> estimates added much so I
dropped the mean line/points).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## - add row names as make variable
## - add noise to cyl for spacing (store as cyl2)
## - plot and format labels with ggrepel
## - adjust x-axis labels
## - specify custom fill colors
mtcars %&gt;%
  mutate(make = row.names(mtcars),
    cyl2 = case_when(
      cyl == 4 ~ cyl - runif(1, .25, .5),
      cyl == 6 ~ cyl - runif(1, .00, .1),
      cyl == 8 ~ cyl + runif(1, .75, 1.25), 
      TRUE ~ cyl
    )) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = cyl2, y = mpg)) + 
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(fill = factor(cyl), label = make), 
    family = &quot;Roboto Condensed Light&quot;, label.padding = 0.2, label.size = .25, 
    min.segment.length = 100, color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 3.4) + 
  my_theme() + 
  my_labs() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(4, 6, 8)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;#efd0ef&quot;, &quot;#d0efd0&quot;, &quot;#d0daef&quot;)) +
  my_save(&quot;img/tick-marks-final.png&quot;)</code></pre>
<p style="align:center">

</p>
<p>As you can see in the code chunk above, I also added some additional noise to
the <code>cyl</code> variable to help out <code>{ggrepel}</code>’s spacing algorithm. The approach
made it possible to plot <em>and label</em> each car in the data set without overloading
or distracting the image with too much information. So, now, not only does the
image convey the pattern between <code>mpg</code> and <code>cyl</code>, but it does so in a way that
more people can recognize ( <em>4-cylinders</em> is less meaningful than <em>Honda Civic</em>, for example),
while arguably being even more visually pleasing.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><sup>1</sup> I knew just enough to read in data,
do some <a href="http://lavaan.ugent.be/">structural equation modeling</a>, and
generate some simple plots via <code>base::plot()</code> and <code>base::histogram()</code>.</p>
