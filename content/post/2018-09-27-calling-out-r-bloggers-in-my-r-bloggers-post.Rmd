Allow me to preface this post by saying I'm a big fan of [R-bloggers](https://
r-bloggers.com), a content aggregating site focused on blog posts about R. It
serves a useful purpose<sup>1</sup> and has considerable reach.<sup>2</sup> So
although what follows may seem combative, I honestly hope R-bloggers continues
to operate and inspire people to use R and share their R-related ideas and tips
for many years to come.

With that said, in this post I argue that <strong>R-bloggers should be better
</strong> than it currently is. To support this argument, I forward the 
following three points:

1. R-bloggers profits from content but produces very little 
1. The service provided by R-bloggers can easily be automated 
1. Its requirements are incommensurate with its contributions

## Background on R-bloggers

Before expanding on these points, I should provide a little more background
on R-bloggers. As I already mentioned, R-bloggers is an R-related content
aggregating site that circulates and indexes blog posts about R. It was created,
as far as I can tell, in 2005 by [Tal Galili](https://www.r-statistics.com/
about/), who is, impressively, still listed as the sole maintainer of the site–
though it also appears to be affiliated with the [Foundation for Open Access
Statistics (FOAS)](http://www.foastat.org/), so, hopefully, they provide Tal
with some support.

As for its mission and a description of its basic operations, here's the 
explanation straight from R-bloggers' 
[about section](https://www.r-bloggers.com/about/):

And here's the explanation of what R-bloggers offers to bloggers:

</figure>

Anyone interested in adding their blog to the R-bloggers feed is also
provided with a [link containing instructions and a submission form for adding
a blog to R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/).

For the most part, the [guidelines for bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/
add-your-blog/) are fairly reasonable–blog posts should be about R, include
a minimum amount of well-written non-code content (i.e., code snippets are
not discouraged, but they should be accompanied by text), contain reasonably
reproducible examples/use cases (if relevant), compatible HTML code, and a link 
back to R-bloggers, etc. There is one requirement, which, although I completely 
understand its rationale, I wish could be relaxed a bit. The requirement is that 
bloggers who also post about things not related to R must explicitly flag 
eligible posts with an "R" category/tag.<sup>3</sup>

If my only qualm with R-bloggers's requirements was that they closed off the 
possibility of non R-related content, this blog post would end here. Instead, 
however, there is one more requirement (and accompanied site design behavior) I 
believe is worthy of scrutiny. The requirement to which I'm referring is that 
bloggers must *"submit a feed with **full content**"*, meaning 
*"abstracts/excerpts will not be accepted."* This, to me, seems like a rather 
steep price of admission, as it allows R-bloggers to link to full-content posts 
**hosted on the R-bloggers domain** and, as a consequence, acquire more clicks 
and ad revenue at the direct expense of traffic to the original blogs. So, it is 
this requirement–along with the aforementioned requirement that I link my blog 
to [R-bloggers](https://r-bloggers.com)–that has inspired my claim, and the 
points below in support of this claim, that given what it asks from 
participating blogs, R-bloggers should be better than it currently is.

## 1. R-bloggers profits from content but produces very little

The **real** contribution from R-bloggers is not the *production* of content,
but the *dissemination* it. And for a site that aggregates content from other
users and then links from its own index to another page on *its same domain*
(r-bloggers.com) that contains a **full repost** of the original content and
only a trivial effort to redirect users to the original blog posts (see screen
shot below for an example), this contribution results in greater reach, more
influence, and higher ad revenues–especially in light of [R's growth in recent
years](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/).

<figcaption>Figure: Screen shot of standard R-bloggers attribution to original content</figcaption> 
</figure> 

In other words, despite producing very little original content, R-bloggers 
profits considerably. And don't get me wrong; I still think the dissemination of 
R-related content is a valuable contribution. I'm just not convinced it's an 
impressive enough contribution to justify those returns. Maybe it was back in 
2005,<sup>4</sup> but in 2018, I would, at the very least, expect the following:

a. Mobile-friendly interface 
  <figure> 
  <p style="align:center"> <img style="max-width:200px;" src="/img/r-bloggers-iphone-x.png"> </p> 
  <figcaption>Figure: Screen shot of R-bloggers as it appears on iPhone X</figcaption> 
  </figure>
a. Links that work as advertised (see: trying to click on [any page after 45](https://www.r-bloggers.com/page/947/)) 
a. Front-end web theme created or overhauled since 2009<sup>5</sup> (the code 
provided below scrapes the WordPress theme's homepage and then prints out the 
log of updates)

```{r}
## load rvest
library(rvest)

## read r-bloggers' theme homepage
h <- read_html("https://themes.bavotasan.com/themes/magazine-basic-wordpress-theme/")

## write ifelse function that works better with piped vectors
if_else <- function(., .e, .t, .f) {
  e <- rlang::enquo(.e)
  e <- rlang::eval_tidy(.e)
  ifelse(e, rlang::eval_tidy(.t), rlang::eval_tidy(.f))
}

## extract changelog text and format for printing
html_nodes(h, "#changelog div.modal-body") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  strsplit("\\s{0,}\n+\\s{0,}|\\s{0,}\r+\\s{0,}") %>%
  unlist() %>%
  grep("^$", ., invert = TRUE, value = TRUE) %>%
  if_else(grepl("^\\d{2}/\\d{2}", .), 
    paste0("\n", ., "  "),
    paste0("- ", ., "  ")) %>%
  .[1:23] %>%
  paste(collapse = "\n") %>%
  paste0("## Changelog for Magazine-Basic Word Press theme\n", .) %>%
  cat(fill = TRUE)
```

In short, while the dissemination of content is a noble contribution, the real
heavy lifting–learning, doing, and communicating innovative data science things
in R–is being done by the actual bloggers, not R-bloggers.com. In fact, as I'll
demonstrate in the second point below, anyone with a free or 
procrastination-filled afternoon can figure out how to string together RSS feeds 
and bundle them into an automated content aggregating website. In contrast, it 
would take several lifetimes to accumulate all the training and knowledge 
expoused by the 750+ bloggers featured on the R-bloggers site.

## 2. The service provided by R-bloggers can easily be automated

Without scraping the R-bloggers website, I was able to accumulate a large list
of R-related blogs by searching for tweets via [rtweet](https://rtweet.info)
containing R-related keywords and URLs that matched at least one of two common
blog post conventions (`/post/` or `2018/\\d{2}/`).

```{r}
## build search query with URL filters
m <- substr(Sys.Date(), 6, 7)
sq <- glue::glue(
  '(rstats OR tidyverse OR "R package") (url:post OR url:2018/{m})')

## search for most recent 100 matching tweets
rt <- rtweet::search_tweets(sq, n = 100)

## print URLs
rt %>%
  pull(urls_expanded_url) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  tfse::na_omit() %>%
  unique()
```


Then, after using [rvest](https://rvest.r-lib.org) to extract post information
and text for previews, I was able to automate, with the help of 
[blogdown](https://blogdown.rstudio.com), a continuously updating website with a
feed containing linked post previews. The task was surprisingly easy. I even 
decided to expand the aim of my content aggregating feed to be about 
data-science generally–hence, its name, `data-scribers`. You can see the site 
for yourself at [data-scribers.mikewk.com](https://data-scribers.mikewk.com). 
*NOTE: since launching this site, it has started to take on a life of its own; 
the range of topics and languages keep growing, and, at this point, I'm more 
interested to see where it goes than I am in pruning it down to English-only 
posts or filtering via some overly-strict definition of data-science.*

Of course, to be competitive with R-bloggers, I'd have to add some more
features (visuals, linked tags, search bar, etc.), but, still, I think [data-
scribers.mikewk.com](https://data-scribers.mikewk.com) illustrates how easy it
is to automate a blog-aggregating website using today's freely available tools.
It also, hopefully, puts in perspective the discrepency between R-bloggers'
contribution and R-bloggers' profits.

## 3. Its requirements are incommensurate with its contributions

My final point doesn't include any new arguments about R-bloggers' requirements 
or contributions. It is merely an appeal to the bigger picture, and my attempt 
to highlight the product of the previous two points–that (1) R-bloggers profits 
from content it doesn't create by (2) providing a relatively easy-to-replicate 
service. I also hope that this final point makes it clear that while I like 
R-bloggers and hope it continues to disseminate R-related content for a long 
time, I would also really like the site to work better on my phone 😁😁😁! 

## Notes

<sup>1</sup> R-bloggers is a centralized directory of "over 750" R-related blogs

<sup>2</sup> At the time of writing, the site has 50k email subscribers, 60k+
Twitter followers, etc.

<sup>3</sup> So, presumably, if a blogger, who is frequently featured on
the R-bloggers feed, writes a post commenting on something like data analysis
used in a trending political topic, but it's not specifically about R, then the
post is excluded from the R-bloggers feed. Like I mentioned before, I completely
understand the rationale behind such a policy–and I can easily imagine a world
where relaxing this restriction could devolve into chaos–but, still, part of me
can't help but feel like the bloggers who help build R-bloggers' audience also
have a right to access that audience even for topics not directly related to R.

<sup>4</sup> The [oldest post I could find](https://www.r-bloggers.com/creating-
shaded-areas-in-r/) is from May 2005

<sup>5</sup> This made for a fun web scraping exercise. The goal was to recreate
the html list text–i.e., `ul > li` while preserving, in meaningful position,
the date/version number text, which preceeded each list but which was was only
tagged with a class-less/id-less `<div>`, in one continuously piped expression.
The hardest part was getting an `ifelse` or `case_when`-type function working
when passing a character vector via the pipe `%>%` operator–hence the reason I
defined the `if_else()` function.
