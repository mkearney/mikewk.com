This post describes how to download and perform a basic local install of R 
and Rstudio. The instructions should work for both macOS and Windows users. Although
not required, installation tends to work best when operating systems are
up-to-date. At the time of writing, this means R/Rstudio work best with
macOS High Sierra and Windows 10.

## R vs Rstudio

**R** is a statistical computing language/environment. It **is distinct from
Rstudio**, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) or high-
powered graphical user interface (GUI) optimized for working with the R
language. In other words, R is the engine, and Rstudio is the interface. 
Consequently, you'll need to install *both* R *and* Rstudio.

## Download and install R

Use the following instructions to download and install the R statistical
computing language/environment:

1. Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: https://cran.r-project.org/
    <img src='/img/install-r2.png'>
1. Click on the appropriate operating system (Mac or Windows) to navigate to download page.
1. Download the most recent version of R. 
   - If Mac, select the first `.pkg` file listed in the "files" section. At time of writing, this is version **`R-3.5.1.pkg`**.

   - If Windows, select the bold, underline link written as **'install R for the first time'**.

1. Double click (run) the downloaded file (check your `Downloads` folder). Click yes through prompts to install like any other program (default values should be okay). You *may* get a warning about the source of the download being unkown. Do whatever you can to allow the installation to continue---I promise the R pkg file is safe!

## Download and install Rstudio

Rstudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easy to 
use R. Once both R and Rstudio are installed, I'd actually recommend ignoring 
the actual "R" program and instead only open and use Rstudio, which will 
automatically call and allow interactive use of R.

1. Go to the free download location on Rstudio's website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
1. Select one of the highlighted options that corresponds with your computer's operating system (Mac or PC)
    <img src='/img/install-rstudio2.png'>
1. Double (run) click the downloaded file (check `Downloads` folder). Click yes through prompts to install like any other program (the defaults should be fine). You may get a warning about the source of the download being unkown. Do whatever you can to allow the installation to continue---I promise the R pkg file is safe!

For an actual demonstration of installing R and Rstudio using these
instructions, see the appropriate video for your operating system below.

## Using R/Rstudio

You should be able to find the **`Rstudio`** application in your computer's `Application` or `Program` folder. Alternatively, a simple search for "Rstudio" using finder/spotlight or the Windows key should be able to locate "Rstudio" 
on your machine.
