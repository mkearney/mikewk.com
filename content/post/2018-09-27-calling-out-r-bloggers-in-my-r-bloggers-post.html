<p>Allow me to preface this post by saying I’m a big fan of
<a href="https://r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers</a>, a content aggregating site focused on
blog posts about R. It serves a useful purpose,<sup>1</sup> and it appears to have
considerable reach.<sup>2</sup> And although what follows may seem a
bit combative, I honestly hope R-bloggers continues to operate
and inspire people to use R for years to come.</p>
<p>With that said, the goal of this post is to make the case that <strong>R-bloggers
should be better</strong>. Toward this end, this post proceeds by making the following
three points:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The basic service provided by R-bloggers can easily be automated</li>
<li>R-bloggers profits from content even though it produces none</li>
<li>R-bloggers’ requirements are incommensurate with its contributions</li>
</ol>

<h2>1. The service provided by R-bloggers can easily be automated</h2>
<p>Without scraping the R-bloggers website or Twitter feed, I was easily able to
accumulate a large list of R-related blogs and then automate a feed of links to
blog posts. The task was so easy, I even decided to expand the aim of my
content aggregating feed to be about data-science more generally–hence, I named
it <code>data-scribers</code>. You can see the site for yourself at
<a href="https://data-scribers.mikewk.com">data-scribers.mikewk.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><sup>1</sup> R-bloggers is a centralized directory of “over 750” R-related blogs</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> At the time of writing, the site has 50k email subscribers, 60k+ Twitter followers, etc.</p>
