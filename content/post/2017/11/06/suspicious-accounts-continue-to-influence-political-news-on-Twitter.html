<h3>Bots and the 2016 election</h3>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/yuri-milner-facebook-twitter-russia.html">what we now know about the Kremlinâ€™s coordinated efforts on social media during the 2016 election</a>, itâ€™s still not hard to find digital tracesâ€”or even the actual profilesâ€”of accounts spreading eggregious examples of misinformation. In the tweet below, for example, I included a screen shot of obviously pro-Trump bot accountsâ€”which mysteriously stopped tweeting on Nov. 2nd 2016thâ€”that I reverse engineered by identifying accounts that had pushed a <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/did-the-pope-endorse-trump/">well-documented lie</a> about Trump being endorsed by the Pope.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>A lot of the accounts that were active during the 2016 election have since been inactive, deleted, or even shut down by Twitter, so itâ€™s tempting to assume the problem is at least somewhat under control. However, based on my experience looking through large amounts of political Twitter data, Iâ€™d say the suspiciously partisan bots continue to operate on a large scale. To give you an example of what Iâ€™m talking about, Iâ€™ll walk you through something I encountered today.</p>

<h3>Bots and recent political news</h3>
<p>For the past week Iâ€™ve been <a href="../../02/tweets-about-mueller-investigation">collecting data about the Mueller investigation</a>. I gathered every public tweet that mentioned Mueller, Gates, Manafort, or Papadolpous. Hereâ€™s the frequency of each in the final data set:</p>
<p><img src="../mueller-final-draw.png" style="width:100%; max-width:900px;"> </img></p>
<p>Notice the weird spike in Manafort mentions? I did. Only, I couldnâ€™t make sense of it.</p>
<p>It could have been due to some new development in external media. After all, media coverage, for the most part, <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM16/paper/viewPaper/13006">still drives Twitter activity</a>. Thus, the spike could have occurred in response to a new article or piece of informationâ€”maybe something related to Manafortâ€™s house arrest. However, a spike in mentions, without a more noticeable residual tail, still seemed odd and probably not explained by some external event in news media. So, I looked a little closer at the data and discovered the spike was due to a very sudden rush of retweets of the following status:</p>
<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Innocent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Innocent</a> until PROVEN guilty. My heart goes out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Manafort?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Manafort</a> family - especially for the attorney daughter - please don't change your name

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>
<p>And hereâ€™s a screen shot of the tweet in case it ever gets deleted:</p>
<p><img src="../retweet.png" style="width:100%; max-width:500px;"> </img></p>
<p>I could have stopped here, deciding that the spike occurred because a fairly popular account tweeted about the presumed innocence of Paul Manafort. But given the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-russia-mueller-manafort-investigation-collusion-2017-11">nature of Manafortâ€™s indictment</a>, isnâ€™t it a little hard to believe that hundreds of users were eager to retweet a status so obviously supportive of Manafort?</p>
<p>Well, I couldnâ€™t beleive it, so I continued to digâ€”this time by examining the list of all the retweeters. Ultimately, I noticed a few flags that led me to believe this weird spike in Manafort mentions was a coordinated effort on the part of hundreds of partisan bots. Iâ€™m sure there are more than four flags that give away these accounts as partisan bots, but these are the first four I ran intoâ€¦and they were enough to convince me.</p>

<h3>Flags of suspicious partisan bots</h3>
<div id="the-retweets-came-in-clusters" class="section level4">
<h4>1. The retweets came in clusters</h4>
<p>The timing of the retweets came in clusters. A few hundred retweets, for example, occurred within only a few couple of minutes in time. Itâ€™s not necessarily uncommon to see hundreds of retweets within a few minutes, but typically that pace doesnâ€™t just come and go so easily.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-accounts-had-very-few-followers" class="section level4">
<h4>2. The accounts had very few followers</h4>
<p>The clustered retweeters followed on average about 100 Twitter accounts. The average number of accounts following them, however, was 0.6. In other words, the average retweeter followed 100 accounts but only <strong>followed by</strong> 1 account.</p>
<p>Given the lack of followers of these accounts, then, itâ€™s a bit odd to see hundreds of accounts retweet the same tweetâ€”that happens to be bizarrely pro-Manafortâ€”especially since the actual retweets <strong>HAD NO AUDIENCE</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-accounts-were-created-in-clusters" class="section level4">
<h4>3. The accounts were created in clusters</h4>
<p>When I looked at the accounts that were retweeting this pro-Manafort status in unison, I found that most were created within the span of one hour of many of the other accounts. Again, this occurred in clusters. During approximately four different hour-long intervals, at least 100 of the accounts <strong>happened</strong> to be created.</p>
</div>
<div id="twitter-already-restricted-several-of-them" class="section level4">
<h4>4. Twitter already restricted several of them</h4>
<p>I discovered this last flag when I started opening profiles of specific accounts in my web browser. Among first five accounts I opened in my browser, for instance, , I found that three had already been deleted by Twitter</p>
<center>
<p><img src="../restricted1.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img></p>
<p><img src="../restricted2.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img></p>
<p><img src="../restricted3.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img></p>
</center>
<p>while the other two were still alive and active.</p>
<p><img src="../live1.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img></p>
<p><img src="../live2.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img></p>
<p>So not only did these accounts already influence the traffic and sentiment around Paul Manafortâ€™s indictment, but many continue to do so via promotion of pro-Trump and/or pro-Kremlin messages!</p>
