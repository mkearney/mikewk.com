### Bots and the 2016 election

Despite [what we now know about the Kremlin's coordinated efforts on
social media during the 2016 election](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/yuri-milner-facebook-twitter-russia.html), it's still not hard to find
digital traces---or even the actual profiles---of accounts spreading
eggregious examples of misinformation. In the tweet below, for example, I
included a screen shot of obviously pro-Trump bot accounts---which
mysteriously stopped tweeting on Nov. 2nd 2016th---that I reverse
engineered by identifying accounts that had pushed a [well-documented lie](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/did-the-pope-endorse-trump/)
about Trump being endorsed by the Pope.

A lot of the accounts that were active during the 2016
election have since been inactive, deleted, or even shut down by
Twitter, so it's tempting to assume the problem is at least somewhat
under control. However, based on my experience looking through large
amounts of political Twitter data, I'd say the suspiciously partisan bots
continue to operate on a large scale. To give you an example of what
I'm talking about, I'll walk you through something I encountered
today.

### Bots and recent political news

For the past week I've been [collecting data about the Mueller
investigation](../../02/tweets-about-mueller-investigation). I gathered
every public tweet that mentioned Mueller, Gates, Manafort, or
Papadolpous. Here's the frequency of each in the final data set:

<img src="../mueller-final-draw.png" style="width:100%; max-width:900px;"> </img>

Notice the weird spike in Manafort mentions? I did. Only, I couldn't
make sense of it.

It could have been due to some new development in external
media. After all, media coverage, for the most part, [still drives
Twitter
activity](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM16/paper/viewPaper/13006). Thus,
the spike could have occurred in response to a new
article or piece of information---maybe something related to
Manafort's house arrest. However, a spike in mentions, without a more
noticeable residual tail, still seemed odd and probably not explained
by some external event in news media. So, I looked a little closer at
the data and discovered the spike was due to a very sudden rush of
retweets of the following status:

<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Innocent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Innocent</a> until PROVEN guilty. My heart goes out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Manafort?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Manafort</a> family - especially for the attorney daughter - please don&#39;t change your name</p>&mdash; Trust Of Syed Doha (@syeddoha) <a href="https://twitter.com/syeddoha/status/926132168044240896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>

And here's a screen shot of the tweet in case it ever gets deleted:

<img src="../retweet.png" style="width:100%; max-width:500px;"> </img>

I could have stopped here, deciding that the spike occurred because a
fairly popular account tweeted about the presumed innocence of Paul
Manafort. But given the [nature of Manafort's
indictment](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-russia-mueller-manafort-investigation-collusion-2017-11),
isn't it a little hard to believe that hundreds of users were eager to
retweet a status so obviously supportive of Manafort?

Well, I couldn't beleive it, so I continued to dig---this time by
examining the list of all the retweeters. Ultimately, I noticed a few
flags that led me to believe this weird spike in Manafort mentions was
a coordinated effort on the part of hundreds of partisan bots. I'm
sure there are more than four flags that give away these accounts as
partisan bots, but these are the first four I ran into...and they were
enough to convince me.

### Flags of suspicious partisan bots

#### 1. The retweets came in clusters

The timing of the retweets came in clusters. A few hundred retweets,
for example, occurred within only a few couple of minutes in
time. It's not necessarily uncommon to see hundreds of retweets within
a few minutes, but typically that pace doesn't just come and go so
easily.

#### 2. The accounts had very few followers

The clustered retweeters followed on average about 100 Twitter
accounts. The average number of accounts following them, however, was
0.6. In other words, the average retweeter followed 100 accounts but
only **followed by** 1 account.

Given the lack of followers of these accounts, then, it's a bit odd to
see hundreds of accounts retweet the same tweet---that happens to be
bizarrely pro-Manafort---especially since the actual retweets **HAD NO
AUDIENCE**.

#### 3. The accounts were created in clusters

When I looked at the accounts that were retweeting this pro-Manafort
status in unison, I found that most were created within the span of
one hour of many of the other accounts. Again, this occurred in
clusters. During approximately four different hour-long intervals, at
least 100 of the accounts **happened** to be created.

#### 4. Twitter already restricted several of them

I discovered this last flag when I started opening profiles of
specific accounts in my web browser. Among first five accounts I
opened in my browser, for instance, , I found that three had already
been deleted by Twitter

<center>

<img src="../restricted1.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img>

<img src="../restricted2.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img>

<img src="../restricted3.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img>

</center>

while the other two were still alive and active.

<img src="../live1.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img>

<img src="../live2.png" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;"> </img>

So not only did these accounts already influence the traffic and
sentiment around Paul Manafort's indictment, but many continue to do
so via promotion of pro-Trump and/or pro-Kremlin messages!
