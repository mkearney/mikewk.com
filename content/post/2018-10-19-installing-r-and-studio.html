<p>This post provides instructions for downloading and installing R and Rstudio.</p>
<div id="download-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Download R</h2>
<p><strong>R</strong> is the language/environment (the engine).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a></li>
<li>Click on the appropriate operating system (Mac or Windows) to navigate to download page.

<img src='/img/install-r-windows.png'></li>
<li>Download the most recent version of R. If Mac, select the first <code>.pkg</code> file listed in the “files” section (e.g., <code>R-3.4.3.pkg</code>). If Windows, select “base” (it’s the same link as the bolded message about ‘installing R for the first time’).</li>
<li>Double (run) click downloaded file (check <code>Downloads</code> folder). Click yes through prompts to install like any other program. You <em>may</em> get a warning about the source of the download being unkown. Do whatever you can to allow the installation to continue—I promise the R pkg file is safe!</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="download-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Download Rstudio</h2>
<p>Rstudio is the graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to use R. Once both R and Rstudio are installed, you can ignore R and only open/use Rstudio moving forward (Rstudio will use R, but you won’t have to interact with it directly).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the free download location on Rstudio’s website: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a></li>
<li>Select one of the highlighted options that corresponds with your computer’s operating system (Mac or PC)
