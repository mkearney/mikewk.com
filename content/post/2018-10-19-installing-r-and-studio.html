<p>This post describes how to download and perform a basic local install of R
and Rstudio. The instructions should work for both macOS and Windows users. Although
not required, installation tends to work best when operating systems are
up-to-date. At the time of writing, this means R/Rstudio work best with
macOS High Sierra and Windows 10.</p>
<div id="r-vs-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>R vs Rstudio</h2>
<p><strong>R</strong> is a statistical computing language/environment. It <strong>is distinct from
Rstudio</strong>, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) or high-
powered graphical user interface (GUI) optimized for working with the R
language. In other words, R is the engine, and Rstudio is the interface.
Consequently, you’ll need to install <em>both</em> R <em>and</em> Rstudio.</p>

<h2>Download and install R</h2>
<p>Use the following instructions to download and install the R statistical
computing language/environment:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>
<img src='/img/install-r2.png'></li>
<li>Click on the appropriate operating system (Mac or Windows) to navigate to download page.</li>
<li>Download the most recent version of R.
<ul>
<li>If Mac, select the first <code>.pkg</code> file listed in the “files” section. At time of writing, this is version <strong><code>R-3.5.1.pkg</code></strong>.
<img src='/img/install-r-mac.png'></li>
<li>If Windows, select the bold, underline link written as <strong>‘install R for the first time’</strong>.
<img src='/img/install-r-windows.png'></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Double click (run) the downloaded file (check your <code>Downloads</code> folder). Click yes through prompts to install like any other program (default values should be okay). You <em>may</em> get a warning about the source of the download being unkown. Do whatever you can to allow the installation to continue—I promise the R pkg file is safe!</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="download-and-install-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Download and install Rstudio</h2>
<p>Rstudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easy to
use R. Once both R and Rstudio are installed, I’d actually recommend ignoring
the actual “R” program and instead only open and use Rstudio, which will
automatically call and allow interactive use of R.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the free download location on Rstudio’s website: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a></li>
<li>Select one of the highlighted options that corresponds with your computer’s operating system (Mac or PC)
<img src='/img/install-rstudio2.png'></li>
<li>Double (run) click the downloaded file (check <code>Downloads</code> folder). Click yes through prompts to install like any other program (the defaults should be fine). You may get a warning about the source of the download being unkown. Do whatever you can to allow the installation to continue—I promise the R pkg file is safe!</li>
</ol>
<p>For an actual demonstration of installing R and Rstudio using these
instructions, see the appropriate video for your operating system below.</p>

<h2>Using R/Rstudio</h2>
<p>You should be able to find the <strong><code>Rstudio</code></strong> application in your computer’s <code>Application</code> or <code>Program</code> folder. Alternatively, a simple search for “Rstudio” using finder/spotlight or the Windows key should be able to locate “Rstudio”
on your machine.</p>
