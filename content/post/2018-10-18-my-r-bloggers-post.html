<p>I have long been a fan of <a href="https://r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers</a>, a content
aggregating site focused on blog posts about R. It serves a useful
purpose<sup>1</sup> and has considerable reach.<sup>2</sup> But in the first
version of this blog post, I actually wrote a lengthy critique of the site where
I concluded with a not-so-blunt suggestion that R-bloggers wasn’t as good as it
should be. In retrospect, and after pleasant exchange about a draft of the post with
<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/rlover/">Tal Galili</a> (the creator and
operator of <a href="https://www.r-statistics.com/about/">R-bloggers</a>), I can
confidently say my post was overly nit-picky and unrealistic in my expectations
for a benevolent blog-aggregating site like R-bloggers.</p>

<h2>Background on R-bloggers</h2>
<p>As I already mentioned, R-bloggers is an R-related content aggregating site that
circulates and indexes blog posts about R. It was created, as far as I can tell,
in 2005 by <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/rlover/">Tal Galili</a>, who is,
impressively, still listed as the sole maintainer of the site–though it also
appears to be affiliated with the
<a href="http://www.foastat.org/">Foundation for Open Access Statistics (FOAS)</a>, so,
hopefully, they provide Tal with some support.</p>
<p>As for its mission and a description of its basic operations, here’s the
explanation straight from R-bloggers’
<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/about/">about section</a>:</p>

<p>And here’s the explanation of what R-bloggers offers to bloggers:</p>

<p>Anyone interested in adding their blog to the R-bloggers feed is also
provided with a <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/">link containing instructions and a submission form for adding
a blog to R-bloggers</a>. The
<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/">guidelines for bloggers</a> are
quite reasonable–blog posts should be about R, include a minimum amount of
well-written non-code content (i.e., code snippets are not discouraged, but they
should be accompanied by text), contain reasonably reproducible examples/use
cases (if relevant), compatible HTML code, and a link back to R-bloggers, etc.</p>

<div id="r-bloggers-contribution-to-rstats" class="section level2">
<h2>R-bloggers’ contribution to #rstats</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the <strong>contribution</strong> made by R-bloggers is not necessarily the <em>production</em> of
content, but the <em>dissemination</em> it. When one considers some of the difficulties
associated with running or automating this kind of service, it’s easy to
understand why the dissemination of R-related content is a valuable contribution.
But it’s perhaps even <strong>easier</strong> to understand the value of its contribution by
actually trying to automate the process yourself…</p>
<p>So, in addition to qualifying as my R-bloggers link, the goal of this post is
to create via automation a content-aggregating R-bloggers-like website.</p>
<div id="identifying-blogs" class="section level3">
<h3>Identifying blogs</h3>
<p>Without scraping the R-bloggers website, I was able to accumulate a large list
of R-related blogs by searching for tweets via <a href="https://rtweet.info">rtweet</a>
containing R-related keywords and URLs that matched at least one of two common
blog post conventions (<code>/post/</code> or <code>2018/\\d{2}/</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## build search query with URL filters
m &lt;- substr(Sys.Date(), 6, 7)
sq &lt;- glue::glue(
  &#39;(rstats OR tidyverse OR &quot;R package&quot;) (url:post OR url:2018/{m})&#39;)

## search for most recent 100 matching tweets
rt &lt;- rtweet::search_tweets(sq, n = 100)

## print URLs
rt %&gt;%
  pull(urls_expanded_url) %&gt;%
  unlist() %&gt;%
  tfse::na_omit() %&gt;%
  unique()

<h2>Automating a website</h2>
<p>Then, after using <a href="https://rvest.r-lib.org">rvest</a> to extract post information
and text previews from RSS feeds, I was able to automate, with the help of
<a href="https://blogdown.rstudio.com">blogdown</a>, a continuously updating website with a
feed containing linked post previews. It took a good amount of elbow grease,
but, at least initially, the task seemed surprisingly doable. I was so confident
in my ability to automate an R-bloggers-like website, I even decided to expand
the aim of my content aggregating feed to be about data-science generally–hence,
the name, <code>data-scribers</code>. You can see the site for yourself at
<a href="https://data-scribers.mikewk.com">data-scribers.mikewk.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-match-for-r-bloggers" class="section level2">
<h2>No match for R-bloggers</h2>
<p>While the initial outcome appeared to be a resounding success, it wasn’t long
before I realized the difficulties involved in pruning (e.g., cutting off text,
including/not including code chunks, dealing with inconsistent formats, etc.),
filtering (e.g., on-topic, non-trivial, consistent language, original content,
non-reposts, etc.), and maintaining (checking/updating/editing algorithm,
tagging posts, creating searchable and/or organized archive, etc.) a site like
R-bloggers would be a lot of work. In fact, since launching
<a href="https://data-scribers.mikewk.com">data-scribers</a>, the site has started to take
on a life of its own; the range of topics and languages keep growing, and, at
this point, I’m more interested to see where it goes than I am in investing
additional time ensuring the feed only contains English posts, filtering via
some overly-strict definition of data-science, battling with HTML formatting
issues, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, even if I had time to prune, filter, and maintain the feed of post
previews, to truly be competitive with R-bloggers, I’d also have to add numerous
other features (visuals, linked tags, search bar, etc.)–and <strong>even then</strong> the
site wouldn’t include any integration with R-related advertisement opportunities
or job postings.</p>

<div id="notes" class="section level2">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><sup>1</sup> R-bloggers is a centralized directory of “over 750” R-related blogs</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> At the time of writing, the site has 50k email subscribers, 60k+
Twitter followers, etc.</p>
