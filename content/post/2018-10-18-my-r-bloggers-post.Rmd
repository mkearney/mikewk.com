I have long been a fan of [R-bloggers](https://r-bloggers.com), a content
aggregating site focused on blog posts about R. It serves a useful
purpose<sup>1</sup> and has considerable reach.<sup>2</sup> But in the first
version of this blog post, I actually wrote a lengthy critique of the site where 
I concluded with a not-so-blunt suggestion that R-bloggers wasn't as good as it
should be. In retrospect, and after pleasant exchange about a draft of the post with
[Tal Galili](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/rlover/) (the creator and 
operator of [R-bloggers](https://www.r-statistics.com/about/)), I can 
confidently say my post was overly nit-picky and unrealistic in my expectations
for a benevolent blog-aggregating site like R-bloggers.

## Background on R-bloggers

As I already mentioned, R-bloggers is an R-related content aggregating site that
circulates and indexes blog posts about R. It was created, as far as I can tell,
in 2005 by [Tal Galili](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/rlover/), who is, 
impressively, still listed as the sole maintainer of the site–though it also 
appears to be affiliated with the 
[Foundation for Open Access Statistics (FOAS)](http://www.foastat.org/), so, 
hopefully, they provide Tal with some support.

As for its mission and a description of its basic operations, here's the 
explanation straight from R-bloggers' 
[about section](https://www.r-bloggers.com/about/):

And here's the explanation of what R-bloggers offers to bloggers:

Anyone interested in adding their blog to the R-bloggers feed is also
provided with a [link containing instructions and a submission form for adding
a blog to R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/). The 
[guidelines for bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/) are
quite reasonable–blog posts should be about R, include a minimum amount of
well-written non-code content (i.e., code snippets are not discouraged, but they
should be accompanied by text), contain reasonably reproducible examples/use 
cases (if relevant), compatible HTML code, and a link back to R-bloggers, etc.

## R-bloggers' contribution to #rstats

Ultimately, the **contribution** made by R-bloggers is not necessarily the *production* of 
content, but the *dissemination* it. When one considers some of the difficulties 
associated with running or automating this kind of service, it's easy to 
understand why the dissemination of R-related content is a valuable contribution.
But it's perhaps even **easier** to understand the value of its contribution by 
actually trying to automate the process yourself...

So, in addition to qualifying as my R-bloggers link, the goal of this post is 
to create via automation a content-aggregating R-bloggers-like website.

### Identifying blogs

Without scraping the R-bloggers website, I was able to accumulate a large list
of R-related blogs by searching for tweets via [rtweet](https://rtweet.info)
containing R-related keywords and URLs that matched at least one of two common
blog post conventions (`/post/` or `2018/\\d{2}/`).

```{r}
## build search query with URL filters
m <- substr(Sys.Date(), 6, 7)
sq <- glue::glue(
  '(rstats OR tidyverse OR "R package") (url:post OR url:2018/{m})')

## search for most recent 100 matching tweets
rt <- rtweet::search_tweets(sq, n = 100)

## print URLs
rt %>%
  pull(urls_expanded_url) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  tfse::na_omit() %>%
  unique()
```

## Automating a website

Then, after using [rvest](https://rvest.r-lib.org) to extract post information
and text previews from RSS feeds, I was able to automate, with the help of 
[blogdown](https://blogdown.rstudio.com), a continuously updating website with a
feed containing linked post previews. It took a good amount of elbow grease, 
but, at least initially, the task seemed surprisingly doable. I was so confident 
in my ability to automate an R-bloggers-like website, I even decided to expand 
the aim of my content aggregating feed to be about data-science generally–hence, 
the name, `data-scribers`. You can see the site for yourself at 
[data-scribers.mikewk.com](https://data-scribers.mikewk.com). 

## No match for R-bloggers

While the initial outcome appeared to be a resounding success, it wasn't long 
before I realized the difficulties involved in pruning (e.g., cutting off text, 
including/not including code chunks, dealing with inconsistent formats, etc.), 
filtering (e.g., on-topic, non-trivial, consistent language, original content, 
non-reposts, etc.), and maintaining (checking/updating/editing algorithm, 
tagging posts, creating searchable and/or organized archive, etc.) a site like 
R-bloggers would be a lot of work. In fact, since launching 
[data-scribers](https://data-scribers.mikewk.com), the site has started to take 
on a life of its own; the range of topics and languages keep growing, and, at 
this point, I'm more interested to see where it goes than I am in investing 
additional time ensuring the feed only contains English posts, filtering via 
some overly-strict definition of data-science, battling with HTML formatting 
issues, etc.

Of course, even if I had time to prune, filter, and maintain the feed of post 
previews, to truly be competitive with R-bloggers, I'd also have to add numerous
other features (visuals, linked tags, search bar, etc.)–and **even then** the 
site wouldn't include any integration with R-related advertisement opportunities
or job postings.

## Notes

<sup>1</sup> R-bloggers is a centralized directory of "over 750" R-related blogs

<sup>2</sup> At the time of writing, the site has 50k email subscribers, 60k+
Twitter followers, etc.
