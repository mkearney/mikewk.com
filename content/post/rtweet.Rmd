## Getting started with Twitter data

Twitter data were already trendy, but the *unpresidented* 2016 U.S.
election has escalated things to a fever pitch. One of the biggest drivers
of the trend is the widespread availability of Twitter data. Twitter
makes much of its user-generated data freely available to the public
via Application Program Interfaces (APIs). APIs refer to sets of
protocols and procedures for interacting with sites. Twitter maintains
several APIs. The two most condusive to data collection are the REST
API and the stream API, both of which I describe below.

Twitter's REST API provides a set of protocols for exploring and
interacting with Twitter data related to user statuses (tweets), user
profiles and timelines, and user network connections. The data are
restful in that they have been archived by Twitter. Navigating these
resting endpoints can, at times, be resource intensive, but it also
makes it possible to perform highly complex and specific queries.

Twitter data not yet archived and accessible via the REST API can be
accessed using Twitter's stream API. As its name suggests, the stream
API provides users with a live stream of Twitter data. Because the
data are streamed, or pushed, to the user, the stream API reduces
overhead associated with performing queries on archived data sources.
This makes it possible to collect large amounts of data very quickly
and with relatively little strain on computational resources. The
downside to the stream API is that it is limited to prospective
(tracking, monitoring, etc.) but not retrospective (surveying,
searching, etc.) queries.

### Installing rtweet

Install from CRAN using `install.packages`.

```{r}
## install from CRAN
install.packages("rtweet")
```

Alternatively, install the most recent [development] version from
Github using `install_github` (from the devtools package).

```{r}
## install from Github (dev version)
if (!"devtools" %in% installed.packages()) {
    install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("mkearney/rtweet", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### API authorization

I've tried to make the API token [oauth] process as painless as
possible. That's why I've included the "auth" vignette, which ships
with the package and contains step-by-step instructions on how to
create and manage your Twitter API token. The vignette also includes
instructions for saving a token as an environment variable, which
automates the token-loading process for all future sessions (at least,
for the machine you're using). View the
[authorization vignette online](https://mkearney.github.io/rtweet/articles/auth.html)
or enter the following code into your R console to load the vignette locally:

```{r}
## Open Twitter token vignette in web browser.
vignette(topic = "auth", package = "rtweet")
```

### Package documentation

In addition to the API authorization vignette, rtweet also includes a
[brief package overview vignette](https://mkearney.github.io/rtweet/articles/intro.html)
as well as a
[vignette demonstrating how to access Twitter's stream API](https://mkearney.github.io/rtweet/articles/stream.html). To
open the vignettes locally, use the code below.

```{r}
## overview of rtweet package
vignette(topic = "intro", package = "rtweet")

## accessing Twitter's stream API
vignette(topic = "stream", package = "rtweet")
```

And thanks to [pkgdown](https://github.com/hadley/pkgdown), rtweet
now has a dedicated
[package documentation website](https://mkearney.github.io/rtweet).
*Btw, while I'm on the subject of package documentation/maintenance,
I'd also like to point out
[rtweet's Github page](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet).
Contributions are welcome and if you run into any bugs or other
issues, users are encouraged to
[create an Github issue](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet/issues).

## Some applied examples

### search_tweets

Searching for tweets is easy. For example, we could search for all
[publically] available statuses from the past 7-10 days that use the
hashtags `#ica17` or `#ica2017`. In the code below I've specified
18,000 statuses (tweets), which is the maximum number a user may
request every 15 minutes.

```{r}
## load rtweet
library(rtweet)

## search for tweets containing ICA17 or ICA2017 (not case sensitive)
ica17 <- search_tweets(
    "#ica17 OR #ica2017", n = 18000, include_rts = FALSE
)
```

If there were more than 18,000 statuses that (a) fit the search query
and (b) exist in the last 7-10 days (the limit put in place by
Twitter), then users can continue where they left off by using the
`max_id` parameter. Since Twitter statuses are returned in order from
newest to oldest, the `max_id` value should just be the last status ID
returned by the previous search.

```{r}
## select last (oldest) status ID from previous search
last_status_id <-  ica17$status_id[nrow(ica17)]

## pass last_status_id to max_id and run search again.
ica17_contd <- search_tweets(
    "#ica17 OR #ica2017", n = 18000, include_rts = FALSE,
    max_id = last_status_id
)
```

Data returned by `search_tweets` is quite extensive. One recently
added feature makes navigating the data a bit easier. As of version
0.4.3, *rtweet* returns `tibble` data frames (assuming the user has
installed the *tibble* package, which is a dependency for nearly
all packages in the tidyverse). Tibbles are especially nice when
working with larger data sets because accidental printing in R has
been known to take years off of one's life (needs citation).

### ts_filter and ts_plot

Included in the rtweet package are a few convenenience functions,
which have been designed to assist in the analysis of Twitter data.
One of these convenient functions is `ts_plot`, which is a
plot-based wrapper around `ts_filter`. The `ts_plot` and `ts_filter`
functions aggregate the frequency of tweets over specified intervals
of time. Hence, the "ts" (time series) naming convention. In addition
to aggregating the frequency of statuses, `ts_plot` will also
plot the time series.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## aggregate freq of tweets in one-hour intervals
agg <- ts_filter(ica17, by = "hours")

## view data
agg

## plot data
ts_plot(agg)
```

The plot produced by `ts_plot` depends on whether the user has
installed *ggplot2*, which is a suggested but not required package
dependency for *rtweet*. If you haven't installed *ggplot2* then
I highly recommend it. Assuming you have, then the object returned
by `ts_plot` can be treated like any other ggplot object, meaning
you can easily add layers and customize the plot to your liking.

```{r}
## load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## plot a time series of tweets, aggregating by one-hour intervals
p1 <- ts_plot(ica17, "hours") +
    labs(
        x = "Date and time",
        y = "Frequency of tweets",
        title = "Time series of #ICA17 tweets",
        subtitle = "Frequency of Twitter statuses calculated in one-hour intervals."
    ) +
    ## a custom ggplot2 theme I mocked up for ICA
    theme_ica17()

## render plot
p1
```

### plain_tweets

The second convenience function for analysing tweets is
`plain_tweets`. As you might guess, `plain_tweets` strips the text of
the tweets down to plain text. Because there are already variables included
in the default tweets data that contain links, hashtags, and mentions, those
entities are stripped out of the text as well. What's returned are lower
case words. Below I've applied the function to the first few ICA17 tweets.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## strip text of tweets
plain_tweets(ica17$text[1:5])
```

The `plain_tweets` function is relatively straight forward at cutting
through the clutter, but it still may not prepare you for quick and
easy analysis. For that, you can use the `tokenize` argument in
`plain_tweets`. The tokenize argument will return a vector of plain
text words for each tweet.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## tokenize by word
wrds <- plain_tweets(ica17$text, tokenize = TRUE)
wrds[1:5]
```

### Identifying stop words

This can easily be converted into a word count [frequency] table, but
it still leaves one problem. The most common words probably aren't going
to tell us a lot about our specific topic / set of tweets.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## get word counts
wrds <- table(unlist(wrds))

## view top 40 words
head(sort(wrds, decreasing = TRUE), 40)
```

See, these words don't appear to be very unique to ICA 2017. Of course, we could always
find a premade list of stopwords to exclude, but those may not appropriately reflect
the medium (Twitter) here. With rtweet, however, it's possible to create your own
dictionary of stopwords by locating overlap between (a) a *particular* sample of
tweets of interest and (b) a more *general* sample of tweets.

To do this, we're going to search for each letter of the alphabet separated
by the boolean ` OR `. It's a bit hacky, but it returns massive amounts of
tweets about a wide range of topics. So, if we can identify the *unique* words
used in our sample, we may yet accomplish our goal.

In the code below, I've excluded retweets since those add unnecessary
redundancies (and, ideally, we'd want a diverse pool of tweets). It's
still not perfect, but it gives us a systematic starting point that
I imagine could be developed into a more reliable method.

```{r}
## construct boolean-exploiting search query
all <- paste(letters, collapse = " OR ")

## conduct search for 5,000 original (non-retweeted) tweets
sw <- search_tweets(all, n = 5000, include_rts = FALSE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## create freq table of all words from general pool of tweets
stopwords <- plain_tweets(sw$text, tokenize = TRUE)
stopwords <- table(unlist(stopwords))
```

Now that we've identified the frequencies of words in this more general pool
of tweets, we can exclude all ICA tweet words that appear more than N number of
times in the general pool.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## cutoff
N <- 5L

## exclude all ica17 words that appear more than N times in stopwords
wrds <- wrds[!names(wrds) %in% names(stopwords[stopwords > N])]

## check top words again
head(sort(wrds, decreasing = TRUE), 40)
```

### Creating a word cloud

That turned out well! These words look a lot more unique to the
topic. We can quickly survey all of these words with a simple word cloud.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## get some good colors
cols <- sample(rainbow(10, s = .5, v = .75), 10)

## plot word cloud
par(bg = "black")
suppressWarnings(wordcloud::wordcloud(
    words = names(wrds),
    freq = wrds,
    min.freq = 5,
    random.order = FALSE,
    random.color = FALSE,
    colors = cols,
    family = "Roboto Condensed",
    scale = c(4.65, .5))
)
```

### Filtering topics

If we wanted to model the topics of tweets, we could conduct two
searches for tweets over the same time period and then compare the
frequencies of tweets over time using time series. That's what I've
done in the example below.

First I searched for tweets mentioning "North Korea", since I know
they conducted another missile test on Monday.

```{r}
## search tweets mentioning north korea (missle test on Monday)
nk <- search_tweets(
    "north korea", n = 18000, include_rts = FALSE
)
```

Then I searched for tweets mentioning "CBO health care" (in any order,
anywhere in the tweet), since I know the CBO was released on Wednesday.

```{r}
## search for tweets about the CBO (released on Wed.)
cbo <- search_tweets(
    "CBO health care", n = 18000, include_rts = FALSE
)
```

And then I combined the two data sets into one big data frame.

```{r}
## create query (search) variable
cbo$query <- "CBO health care"
nk$query <- "North Korea"

## row bind into single data frame
df <- rbind(cbo, nk)
```

Using the `ts_plot` function, I then provide a list of `filter` words
(via regular expression; the bar is like an "OR"). Use the `key` argument
if you want to have nicer looking filter labels. By default `ts_plot`
will create groups based on the text of the tweet and the filters provided.
However, you can pass along the name of any variable in DF and the function
will use that to classify groups. In the code below, I applied `plain_tweets`
to the text to create a new variable, and then specified that I wanted to
apply the filters to that variable by using the `txt` argument in `ts_plot`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## create plain tweets variable
df$text_plain <- plain_tweets(df$text)

## filter by search topic
p3 <- ts_plot(
    df, by = "15 mins",
    filter = c("cbo|health|care|bill|insured|deficit|budget",
               "korea|kim|jung un|missile"),
    key = c("CBO", "NKorea"),
    txt = "text_plain"
)
```

Now it's easy to add more layers and make this plot look nice.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## add theme and more style layers
p3 <- p3 +
    theme_ica17() +
    scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b %d %H:%m") +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
         title = "Tracing topic salience in Twitter statuses",
         subtitle = paste("Tweets (N = 23,467) were aggregated in 15-minute",
                          "intervals. Retweets were not included.")
    )

## render plot
p3
```

### Tidy sentiment analysis

The *syuzhet* package makes sentiment analysis criminally easy.

```{r}
## conduct sentiment analysis
sa <- syuzhet::get_nrc_sentiment(df$text_plain)
```

Within a few seconds, the analysis returns coded variables for several
categories of emotion and valence. A preview of the sentiment scores
returned by `get_nrc_sentiment` is provided below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## view output
tibble::as_tibble(sa)
```

Since the return object is a data frame with the same number of rows
as the CBO/North Korea data, the columns can easily be combined to
create one data frame.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## bind columns
df <- cbind(df, sa)
```

This data structure is useful for most media researchers, but it's not very
flexible---either for summarizing the data or for visualizing it. Fortunately,
recent advancements<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> in data wrangling in R make converting this wide data to
tidy, long data a breeze. In the code below, I've created a user function
to assist in time-rounding efforts, and I've enlisted *dplyr* and *tidyr* to do
the dirty work.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## load dplyr
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

## create function for aggregating date-time vectors
round_time <- function(x, interval = 60) {
    ## round off to lowest value
    rounded <- floor(as.numeric(x) / interval) * interval
    ## center so value is interval mid-point
    rounded <- rounded + round(interval * .5, 0)
    ## return to date-time
    as.POSIXct(rounded, origin = "1970-01-01")
}

## use pipe (%>%) operator for linear syntax
long_emotion_ts <- df %>%
    ## select variables (columns) of interest
    dplyr::select(created_at, query, anger:positive) %>%
    ## convert created_at variable to desired interval
    ## here I chose 6 hour intervals (3 * 60 seconds * 60 mins = 3 hours)
    mutate(created_at = round_time(created_at, 3 * 60 * 60)) %>%
    ## transform data to long form
    tidyr::gather(sentiment, score, -created_at, -query) %>%
    ## group by time, query, and sentiment
    group_by(created_at, query, sentiment) %>%
    ## get mean for each grouping
    summarize(score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
              n = n()) %>%
    ungroup()
```

The result is a tidy data paradise:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## view data
long_emotion_ts
```

Which we can pass right along to *ggplot2* for the finish:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## plot data
long_emotion_ts %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = created_at, y = score, color = query)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    facet_wrap(~ sentiment, scale = "free_y", nrow = 2) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(text = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed"),
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
          legend.position = "bottom",
          axis.text = element_text(size = 9),
          legend.title = element_blank()) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
         title = "Sentiment analysis of Twitter statuses over time",
         subtitle = "Tweets aggregated by hour on topics of the CBO and North Korea") +
    scale_x_datetime(date_breaks = "18 hours", date_labels = "%b %d")
```


And that's it!


<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: I'll admit that for a time I was hesitant to embrace
the collection of packages collectively known as the *tidyverse* (formerly
known as the *Hadley*verse; see: [https://github.com/hadley](https://github.com/hadley)).
But the tidyverse, and especially *dplyr*, is really quite amazing.
