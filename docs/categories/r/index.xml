      <description>I still remember how hard it was to learn ggplot2 after only knowing a little about R1. Sure, the plots seemed pretty. But compared to the ways I had used R before, ggplot2&amp;rsquo;s syntax seemed almost counter-intuitive. Its pipe-like + workflow of building layer-by-layer was like nothing I had ever used before. Not to mention, I was unfamiliar with central terms of art like &amp;ldquo;geoms&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;aesthetics&amp;rdquo;.
But then again&amp;hellip;the plots were really pretty.</description>
