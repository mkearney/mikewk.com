      <description>Allow me to preface this post by saying I’m a big fan of R-bloggers, a content aggregating site focused on blog posts about R. It serves a useful purpose,1 and it appears to have considerable reach.2 And although what follows may seem a bit combative, I honestly hope R-bloggers continues to operate and inspire people to use R for years to come.
With that said, the goal of this post is to make the case that R-bloggers should be better.</description>

      <description>Allow me to preface this post by saying I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of R-bloggers, a content aggregating site focusing on blog posts about R. It serves a useful purpose–a centralized directory of &amp;ldquo;over 750&amp;rdquo; R-related blogs–and appears to have a considerable reach–50k email subscribers, 60k+ Twitter followers, etc. And although what follows may seem combative, I honestly hope R-bloggers continues to operate and inspire people to use R for years to come.</description>

      <description>I still remember how hard it was to learn {ggplot2} after only knowing a little about R1. Sure, the plots seemed pretty. But compared to the ways I had used R before, {ggplot2}’s syntax seemed almost counter-intuitive. Its pipe-like + workflow–building layer-by-layer– was like nothing I had ever used before. Not to mention, I was unfamiliar with central terms of art like “geoms” and “aesthetics”.
But then again…the plots were really pretty.</description>

      <title>Tick marks, variable names, and ggplot2</title>

      <description>A popular workflow in R uses {dplyr} to group_by() and then summarise()1 variables. It&amp;rsquo;s an intuitive and easy way to aggregate and describe data, especially along multiple dimensions. The cost of being both powerful and user-friendly, however, is its arguably inconvenient default method for assigning names to summarized values. As the code illustrates below, users can provide their own names when using summarize().
## explicitly named summarize variable mtcars %&amp;gt;% group_by(cyl) %&amp;gt;% summarize(mpg = mean(mpg)) #&amp;gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2 #&amp;gt; cyl mpg #&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; #&amp;gt; 1 4 26.</description>
