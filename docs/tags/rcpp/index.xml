      <description>Recently I was asked if I could add to {rtweet} some basic functions for converting Twitter data into network data objects. I thought this was a reasonable request and a good opportunity for me to learn more about network analysis. But the task of converting Twitter data into network-friendly objects is something that has, at least for me, been really slow and inefficient. So, for the past several weeks, I’ve been slowly working toward what I think believe a simple but efficient solution.</description>
