      <description>I have long been a fan of R-bloggers, a content aggregating site focused on blog posts about R. It serves a useful purpose1 and has considerable reach.2 But in the first version of this blog post, I actually wrote a lengthy critique of the site where I concluded with a not-so-blunt suggestion that R-bloggers wasn’t as good as it should be. In retrospect, and after pleasant exchange about a draft of the post with Tal Galili (the creator and operator of R-bloggers), I can confidently say my post was overly nit-picky and unrealistic in my expectations for a benevolent blog-aggregating site like R-bloggers.</description>

      <description>A friend from grad school recently asked me about rotated solutions in exploratory factor analysis (EFA). It reminded me of two default EFA settings in SPSS, which, in my estimation, leads lots of social science researchers astray. The goal of this post is two describe those two settings and demonstrate some desirable alternatives.
Kaiser cutoff criteria There’s not a lot of theoretical support behind the decision to retain a number of factors based on the number of eigenvalues greater than 1.</description>
