      <description>Allow me to preface this post by saying I’m a big fan of R-bloggers, a content aggregating site focused on blog posts about R. It serves a useful purpose,1 and it appears to have considerable reach.2 And although what follows may seem a bit combative, I honestly hope R-bloggers continues to operate and inspire people to use R for years to come.
With that said, the goal of this post is to make the case that R-bloggers should be better.</description>

      <description>Allow me to preface this post by saying I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of R-bloggers, a content aggregating site focusing on blog posts about R. It serves a useful purpose–a centralized directory of &amp;ldquo;over 750&amp;rdquo; R-related blogs–and appears to have a considerable reach–50k email subscribers, 60k+ Twitter followers, etc. And although what follows may seem combative, I honestly hope R-bloggers continues to operate and inspire people to use R for years to come.</description>
