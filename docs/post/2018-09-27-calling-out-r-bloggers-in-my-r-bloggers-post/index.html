    <article class="post-content"><p>Allow me to preface this post by saying I’m a big fan of <a href="https://%20r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers</a>, a content aggregating site focused on blog posts about R. It
serves a useful purpose<sup>1</sup> and has considerable reach.<sup>2</sup> So
although what follows may seem combative, I honestly hope R-bloggers continues
to operate and inspire people to use R and share their R-related ideas and tips
for many years to come.</p>
<p>With that said, in this post I argue that <strong>R-bloggers should be better
</strong> than it currently is. To support this argument, I forward the
following three points:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>R-bloggers profits from content but produces very little</li>
<li>The service provided by R-bloggers can easily be automated</li>
<li>Its requirements are incommensurate with its contributions</li>
</ol>
<div id="background-on-r-bloggers" class="section level2">
<h2>Background on R-bloggers</h2>
<p>Before expanding on these points, I should provide a little more background
on R-bloggers. As I already mentioned, R-bloggers is an R-related content
aggregating site that circulates and indexes blog posts about R. It was created,
as far as I can tell, in 2005 by <a href="https://www.r-statistics.com/%20about/">Tal Galili</a>, who is, impressively, still listed as the sole maintainer of the site–
though it also appears to be affiliated with the <a href="http://www.foastat.org/">Foundation for Open Access
Statistics (FOAS)</a>, so, hopefully, they provide Tal
with some support.</p>
<p>As for its mission and a description of its basic operations, here’s the
explanation straight from R-bloggers’
<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/about/">about section</a>:</p>
<figure>
<p style="align:center">
<img style="max-width:600px" src="/img/r-bloggers-what.png" >
</p>
<figcaption>
Figure: Screen shot of R-bloggers description/operation
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And here’s the explanation of what R-bloggers offers to bloggers:</p>
<figure>
<p style="align:center">
<img style="max-width:600px" src="/img/r-bloggers-contribution.png" >
</p>
<figcaption>
Figure: Screen shot of R-bloggers contribution description
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Anyone interested in adding their blog to the R-bloggers feed is also
provided with a <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/">link containing instructions and a submission form for adding
a blog to R-bloggers</a>.</p>
<p>For the most part, the <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/%20add-your-blog/">guidelines for bloggers</a> are fairly reasonable–blog posts should be about R, include
a minimum amount of well-written non-code content (i.e., code snippets are
not discouraged, but they should be accompanied by text), contain reasonably
reproducible examples/use cases (if relevant), compatible HTML code, and a link
back to R-bloggers, etc. There is one requirement, which, although I completely
understand its rationale, I wish could be relaxed a bit. The requirement is that
bloggers who also post about things not related to R must explicitly flag
eligible posts with an “R” category/tag.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>If my only qualm with R-bloggers’s requirements was that they closed off the
possibility of non R-related content, this blog post would end here. Instead,
however, there is one more requirement (and accompanied site design behavior) I
believe is worthy of scrutiny. The requirement to which I’m referring is that
bloggers must <em>“submit a feed with <strong>full content</strong>”</em>, meaning
<em>“abstracts/excerpts will not be accepted.”</em> This, to me, seems like a rather
steep price of admission, as it allows R-bloggers to link to full-content posts
<strong>hosted on the R-bloggers domain</strong> and, as a consequence, acquire more clicks
and ad revenue at the direct expense of traffic to the original blogs. So, it is
this requirement–along with the aforementioned requirement that I link my blog
to <a href="https://r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers</a>–that has inspired my claim, and the
points below in support of this claim, that given what it asks from
participating blogs, R-bloggers should be better than it currently is.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-bloggers-profits-from-content-but-produces-very-little" class="section level2">
<h2>1. R-bloggers profits from content but produces very little</h2>
<p>The <strong>real</strong> contribution from R-bloggers is not the <em>production</em> of content,
but the <em>dissemination</em> it. And for a site that aggregates content from other
users and then links from its own index to another page on <em>its same domain</em>
(r-bloggers.com) that contains a <strong>full repost</strong> of the original content and
only a trivial effort to redirect users to the original blog posts (see screen
shot below for an example), this contribution results in greater reach, more
influence, and higher ad revenues–especially in light of <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/">R’s growth in recent
years</a>.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other words, despite producing very little original content, R-bloggers
profits considerably. And don’t get me wrong; I still think the dissemination of
R-related content is a valuable contribution. I’m just not convinced it’s an
impressive enough contribution to justify those returns. Maybe it was back in
2005,<sup>4</sup> but in 2018, I would, at the very least, expect the following:</p>

<p>In short, while the dissemination of content is a noble contribution, the real
heavy lifting–learning, doing, and communicating innovative data science things
in R–is being done by the actual bloggers, not R-bloggers.com. In fact, as I’ll
demonstrate in the second point below, anyone with a free or
procrastination-filled afternoon can figure out how to string together RSS feeds
and bundle them into an automated content aggregating website. In contrast, it
would take several lifetimes to accumulate all the training and knowledge
expoused by the 750+ bloggers featured on the R-bloggers site.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-service-provided-by-r-bloggers-can-easily-be-automated" class="section level2">
<h2>2. The service provided by R-bloggers can easily be automated</h2>
<p>Without scraping the R-bloggers website, I was able to accumulate a large list
of R-related blogs by searching for tweets via <a href="https://rtweet.info">rtweet</a>
containing R-related keywords and URLs that matched at least one of two common
blog post conventions (<code>/post/</code> or <code>2018/\\d{2}/</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## build search query with URL filters

## search for most recent 100 matching tweets

#&gt; [8] &quot;https://mailund.github.io/r-programmer-blog/2018/10/02/promises-their-environments-and-how-we-evaluate-them/&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Then, after using <a href="https://rvest.r-lib.org">rvest</a> to extract post information
and text for previews, I was able to automate, with the help of
<a href="https://blogdown.rstudio.com">blogdown</a>, a continuously updating website with a
feed containing linked post previews. The task was surprisingly easy. I even
decided to expand the aim of my content aggregating feed to be about
data-science generally–hence, its name, <code>data-scribers</code>. You can see the site
for yourself at <a href="https://data-scribers.mikewk.com">data-scribers.mikewk.com</a>.
<em>NOTE: since launching this site, it has started to take on a life of its own;
the range of topics and languages keep growing, and, at this point, I’m more
interested to see where it goes than I am in pruning it down to English-only
posts or filtering via some overly-strict definition of data-science.</em></p>
<p>Of course, to be competitive with R-bloggers, I’d have to add some more
features (visuals, linked tags, search bar, etc.), but, still, I think <a href="https://data-scribers.mikewk.com">data-
scribers.mikewk.com</a> illustrates how easy it
is to automate a blog-aggregating website using today’s freely available tools.
It also, hopefully, puts in perspective the discrepency between R-bloggers’
contribution and R-bloggers’ profits.</p>
</div>
<div id="its-requirements-are-incommensurate-with-its-contributions" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Its requirements are incommensurate with its contributions</h2>
<p>My final point doesn’t include any new arguments about R-bloggers’ requirements
or contributions. It is merely an appeal to the bigger picture, and my attempt
to highlight the product of the previous two points–that (1) R-bloggers profits
from content it doesn’t create by (2) providing a relatively easy-to-replicate
service. I also hope that this final point makes it clear that while I like
R-bloggers and hope it continues to disseminate R-related content for a long
time, I would also really like the site to work better on my phone 😁😁😁!</p>
</div>
<div id="notes" class="section level2">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><sup>1</sup> R-bloggers is a centralized directory of “over 750” R-related blogs</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> At the time of writing, the site has 50k email subscribers, 60k+
Twitter followers, etc.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> So, presumably, if a blogger, who is frequently featured on
the R-bloggers feed, writes a post commenting on something like data analysis
used in a trending political topic, but it’s not specifically about R, then the
post is excluded from the R-bloggers feed. Like I mentioned before, I completely
understand the rationale behind such a policy–and I can easily imagine a world
where relaxing this restriction could devolve into chaos–but, still, part of me
can’t help but feel like the bloggers who help build R-bloggers’ audience also
have a right to access that audience even for topics not directly related to R.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> The <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/creating-%20shaded-areas-in-r/">oldest post I could find</a> is from May 2005</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> This made for a fun web scraping exercise. The goal was to recreate
the html list text–i.e., <code>ul &gt; li</code> while preserving, in meaningful position,
the date/version number text, which preceeded each list but which was was only
tagged with a class-less/id-less <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, in one continuously piped expression.
The hardest part was getting an <code>ifelse</code> or <code>case_when</code>-type function working
when passing a character vector via the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> operator–hence the reason I
defined the <code>if_else()</code> function.</p>
